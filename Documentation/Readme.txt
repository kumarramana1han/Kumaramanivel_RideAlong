This project contains the material for my Udacity's VRND Capstone. 

INTRODUCTION
The user is given three options,
1. Visit the streets of India
2. Visit a temple
3. Play a game
When one chooses an option, one is given an experience respectively,
For instance when one chooses the option to visit the streets of India, one is given a 360 tour of a street in India.

HOW THE PROJECT WAS DEVELOPED?

First I build two separate projects one for the 360 tour and the another for the interactive game of tic-tac-toe then I imported the scene of one project into another.

GAMEPLAY VIDEO
This video is the gameplay and also explains about achievements: https://vimeo.com/269877803

HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT 
To run the project you have to open the scene ‘India’.

AUDIO
Three spatial audios have been used in the project, there are totally three options offered to the user, and each one has a spatial audio respectively.

EMOTION
The emotion I'm trying to achieve here is joy and surprise. Personally, VR experiences surprise me and never fail in fascinating me. I have used music which provoke happy emotions, in order to give the user a joyous feeling.
CONTENTS
This folder Kumaramanivel_capstone comprises of the project files and the project build.

USER TESTING

Initial trial

April 2nd week,
User: Rama

1.How big/small do you feel in the experience ?
Answer : “ The videos are not on the horizon with my eye level.”
2. What is the mood and setting like?
Answer : “The background music gives a happy feeling!”
3. Is there anything you like to look but difficult to see?
Answer : “ The 360 videos appear to be a little tilted as in they are not at eye level, which is pretty much annoying and also gives a dizzy feeling”
4. Can you identify the elements you can interact with?
Answer : “ There were three choices given to me and I was able to choose one,but the game happens to be stuck once I finish the game.”

FINDINGS OF USER TEST :
The user was able to identify the setting he’s in and also was able to find out that he’s supposed to do. Although, there are some improvements that have to be made, the video appears to be tilted and also the project happens to be stuck.

Corrections Made :
Stitched the 360 video again from scratch and edited it and made sure it was in the horizon with my eye level. As far as the game being stuck, I noticed I hadn't used the scene management engine. 

After Corrections

User: Kumudha

1.How big/small do you feel in the experience ?
Answer : “ I feel normal, everything happens to be in scale, it is actually fascinating.”
2. What is the mood and setting like?
Answer : “I was actually pretty surprised and was fascinated by the whole thing!”
3. Is there anything you like to look but difficult to see?
Answer : “ while playing the game the surrounding lights are too bright, and once I chose the option to visit the temple, it took a while for the tour to appear, but there happens to be no problem while viewing.”
4. Can you identify the elements you can interact with?
Answer : “ The O's in the X and O game, also I was able to pause and restart the videos.”

FINDINGS OF USER TEST :
The light needs to be fixed and the cloud service I had been using is not effective, so must upload the videos to a different server.
